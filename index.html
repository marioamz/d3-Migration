          <div class='title'>In 2018, the nature of Central American migration through Mexico changed</div>
          Rather than travel alone, Central American migrants began travelling in caravans. While the discussion around these caravans has rightfully focused on the violence driving vulnerable populations to emigrate, relatively little has been said about the route the migrant caravan chose to take.

          <div class="title">The October 13 Migrant Caravan decided to take a route along the Pacific coast</div>
          The caravan which left <a href='https://cis.org/Migrant-Caravan-Map'>San Pedro Sula, Honduras on October 13, 2018,</a> entered Mexico through Tapachula, Chiapas, headed inland to Mexico City, and then hugged the Pacific coastline on its way to the Tijuana-San Diego border.

          <div class="title">Their choice of route was unorthodox</div>
          Traditionally, Central American migrants have always preferred to travel along the Gulf of Mexico, a much shorter route. In 2017, Central American migrants were far more likely to report stopping by a city on the Gulf of Mexico on their journey to the United States. By mousing over the cities on the map, you'll notice that in 2017, 2942 migrants named the eastern border city of Reynosa as a stop on their route. Only 117 named Tijuana.

          <div class="title">The decision to take the Pacific route was purposeful</div>
          Upon reaching Mexico City, <a href = 'https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2018/12/09/why-do-migrant-caravans-central-america-travel-tijuana/2206334002/'>members of the caravan</a> held group meetings to discuss the route to take to the US border. They chose to take the Pacific route to avoid travelling through dangerous states like Veracruz, San Luis Potos√≠, and Tamaulipas. By mousing over the states in the map, you'll notice that 54% of migrants who named Veracruz as a stop in 2017 self-reported experiencing dangerous situations on their journey.

          <div class="title">The caravans were optimized for safety</div>
          The size of the caravans wasn't the only form of protection for the migrants. By travelling in larger, organized groups, they were able to convene in order to make more informed decisions regarding which routes to take in order to reach the US-Mexico border safely.
